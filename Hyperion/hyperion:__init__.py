"""
Hyperion: Distributed LLM Fine-Tuning Framework
===============================================

A comprehensive framework for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models
with emphasis on computational efficiency, distributed training orchestration, and
production-grade deployment pipelines.

Core components:
- Parameter-efficient adapters (LoRA, QLoRA, IAÂ³)
- Memory-hierarchical quantization
- Distributed sharded training
- Hardware-aware compilation
- Continuous evaluation
- One-command deployment

See https://hyperion-labs.github.io/docs for full documentation.
